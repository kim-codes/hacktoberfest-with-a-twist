Last year I was a part of the incredible community team over at [Auth0](https://github.com/auth0) and I wrote a blog post descrbing what is [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), how to get involved, what swag as to do with it, and how Auth0 was participating. [Celebrate Hacktoberfest 2018 with Auth0!](https://auth0.com/blog/celebrate-hacktoberfest-with-auth0/) 

I am proud to say I have joined Microsoft this year as a Developer Engagement Lead in Canada. While I am on my new journey, I am still continuing my passion for the developer community and ecosystem as a whole. With that, Hacktoberfest holds a special place in my :purple_heart: so I created this repository to stand alone from any company and any organization to share content.

# Hacktoberfest with a twist

[English message]

Last year I was a part of the incredible community team over at Auth0 and I wrote a blog post descrbing what is Hacktoberfest, how to get involved, what swag as to do with it, and how Auth0 was participating. Celebrate Hacktoberfest 2018 with Auth0!

I am proud to say I have joined Microsoft this year as a Developer Engagement Lead in Canada. While I am on my new journey, I am still continuing my passion for the developer community and ecosystem as a whole. With that, Hacktoberfest holds a special place in my ðŸ’œ so I created this repository to stand alone from any company and any organization to share content.
